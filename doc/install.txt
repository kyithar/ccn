Thank you for joining the ccnSim community! This is a brief installation guide.

You can freely download ccnSim from the project site: http://ccnsim.googlecode.com. 

We assume that you have downloaded and installed Omnet++ (version >= 4.1) on your machine. 

The new version of  makes use of the boost libraries, thus you should have a minimal boost installation on your system. 

In order to install ccnSim, it is first necessary to patch your omnet installation. Then, you can compile the ccnSim source code. These steps are as follows:

john:~$ cd CCNSIM_DIR
john:CCNSIM_DIR$ cp ./patch/ctopology.h OMNET_DIR/include/
john:CCNSIM_DIR$ cp ./patch/ctopology.cc OMNET_DIR/src/sim
john:CCNSIM_DIR$ cd  OMNET_DIR && make && cd CCNSIM
john:CCNSIM_DIR$ ./scripts/makemake
john:CCNSIM_DIR$ make

We suppose that CCNSIM_DIR and OMNET_DIR contain the installation directory of ccnSim  and Omnet++ respectively.
